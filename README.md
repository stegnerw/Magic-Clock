# Magic-Clock

Based on [brgerig's Magic-Clock](https://github.com/brgerig/Magic-Clock).
The primary changes include:

- Adding one more hand
- Replacing the NodeMCU Arduino Pro Mini setup with a single Arduino Nano ESP32

## Background

In the Harry Potter books and movies, Harry's friends, the Weasleys, have a magical clock that tracks where all of the family members are.
This project creates a functional version of that clock, using data from phone GPS by way of an MQTT message broker.
